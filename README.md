# Project Overview
This Healthcare Analytics Power BI Project focuses on transforming a large-scale hospital dataset containing over 55,000 patient records into meaningful insights that enhance decision-making and operational efficiency. The dataset includes key healthcare metrics such as patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital charges, admission types, insurance coverage, and treatment outcomes, allowing for a 360° analysis of hospital performance and patient care.

The project consists of multiple interactive dashboards that showcase:

KPI Cards highlighting total patients, average age, BMI, and stay duration.

Geographic Insights using filled maps to visualize patient distribution and BMI trends across states and genders.

Demographic Breakdown through donut and bar charts showing gender ratio, blood group diversity, and admission type distribution.

Medical Insights identifying the most common diseases (e.g., Arthritis) and frequently prescribed medications (e.g., Lipitor).

The goal is to leverage data storytelling in Power BI to uncover critical insights such as high dependency on emergency admissions, prevalent chronic conditions, and regional health risk patterns. These findings can help healthcare administrators optimize staffing, resource allocation, and preventive care strategies.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how Power BI can turn raw healthcare data into actionable intelligence — enabling hospitals to improve patient outcomes, manage costs effectively, and make evidence-based strategic decisions in healthcare operations.
